Featureous is a tool integrated with the NetBeans IDE. It helps to:
- Easily establish traceability links between user-visible features and legacy source code.
- Use these links to understand feature implementations, to guide evolutionary changes and to control the quality of your code.
- Restructure your source code to localize and untangle features.
